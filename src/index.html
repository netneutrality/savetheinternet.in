                    Mumbai is breathing toxic air and it's citizens are gasping. The government and the administrative establishment are unfazed and unwilling
                    to SHUT down the dumping ground, which is operating beyond its capacity and expiry date. ACT NOW, do your precious bit, save the

          <p>The Deonar Dumping Ground in Mumbai is a century old, one of Asia's largest dumping grounds that is still in use.
            There are frequent fires in the ground, and it emits toxic gases like Dioxin, heavy intensity smoke and very strong stench.
            Such occurrences, through the year, have had a significant daily impact on the Air Quality of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai  areas, and every citizen has been deprived
            of the basic right of clean air to breathe. </p>

          <p>3. Hand over possession to the BMC, of an alternate site for garbage dumping immediately, without any further delay, keeping in mind the best interests
            of your citizens. This alternate site should be of a sufficient size and scale as would be required to replace the Deonar dumping ground. </p>
