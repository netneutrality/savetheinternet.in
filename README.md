Join us in fighting for clean, breathable air. Letâ€™s remind the CM BMC & PMO that their job is to protect the rights of citizens, not the profit margins of telcos. Letâ€™s demand our right to clean, breathable air.


## Help us ##
Help us by [reporting issues and by giving suggestions](https://github.com/mumbaipollution/mumbaipollution.org/issues), or contributing to the code.

If you'd like to join our discussions, please contact us via email.

### Code
Please make all Pull Requests against the `stage` branch. Pull Requests made against `master` will have to be closed and made against `stage`.

If you are making major changes, create a new issue (or comment on the existing issue) and tell that you are working on it (we might already be working on it). And work on a new branch. For example,
```
> git checkout -b large-bug-fix-issue-19
```
Please make sure you merge the latest commits from `stage` into your pull request at the time of creating it. If there are conflicts while merging your pull request we will ask you to pull the latest changes, resolve conflicts, and come back. To do this:
```
> # add remote repo if you haven't already
> git remote add upstream git@github.com:mumbaipollution/mumbaipollution.org.git

> # fetch and incorporate upstream changes
> git fetch upstream
> git checkout stage
> git pull --rebase upstream stage

> # go back to your branch and resolve the issues
> git checkout large-bug-fix-issue-19
> git rebase stage
```

*Optional:* Install [editorconfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) on your editor/IDE, in order to maintain consistence file formatting.
