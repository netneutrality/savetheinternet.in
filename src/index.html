                  <div class="hidden">Dear Sir,</div>

                  <div class="hidden">Re: Response to the Consultation on Regulatory Framework for Over-the-top (OTT) Services/ Internet Services and Net Neutrality</div>

                  <div class="hidden">We wish to thank you for providing us the opportunity to submit our views on the consultation paper on the Regulatory Framework for OTT Services, Internet Services and Network Neutrality released on March 27, 2015 by the TRAI (referred to as the “Internet Licensing Paper”). We are signing onto this letter and the supporting submissions on the specific queries listed in the Internet Licensing Paper. Before proceeding to the submissions which we wish to make some general comments on the paper itself.</div>



                  <div class="argument">
                    Any consultation paper is aimed at providing a background to a reader which is neutral and helps them arrive at an informed opinion. This is unfortunately absent from the Internet Licensing Paper. It seems to have been drafted catering exclusively to the interests of the telecom industry. The interests of ordinary internet users should precede any corporate interests or arguments for profit. Also the interests of the technology industry which is giving a high degree of growth to the Indian economy are largely ignored. The Internet Licensing Paper makes broad assumptions and takes statements by the telecom industry without any verification or the demonstration of empirical proof. It further then poses questions on the basis of them. Naturally they are skewed in the favour of telecom companies.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The way the paper is structured is a cause of concern. Experts like us are demanding network neutrality laws to protect against discrimination in traffic data and blocking and double charging on specific internet services. To this the TRAI has posed question on the licensing of such services itself. By doing so, it has adopted an extremely regressive position which is contrary to user interest. The signatories to this, clearly want two things. First, no licensing of Internet Services and second network neutrality regulations to be issued urgently. This is our clear position and of many other supporting organisations and individuals. Further detail on this is provided in answers to the specific queries listed in the Internet Licensing Paper below.</div>
                    <div class="argument">We request that a transparent process with respect to this consultation may be followed to inspire greater confidence and trust. You are requested to publicly publish our response on the TRAI website as has been done in the past when any member of the public has commented. Further the TRAI is requested to issue a specific response to submissions after collating the concerns which arise from them before making any recommendation.</div>
                    <div class="hidden">Thanking you,</div>
                    <div class="special"><label>Your full name <input name="fname"/></label> <label>Your email address <input name="fname"/></label></div>

                    <div class="question">Question 1: Is it too early to establish a regulatory framework for Internet/OTT services, since internet penetration is still evolving, access speeds are generally low and there is limited coverage of high-speed broadband in the country? Or, should some beginning be made now with a regulatory framework that could be adapted to changes in the future? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 1: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. No regulatory framework is required and no such “beginning’ should be made.</div>

                    <div class="argument">The points which provide further justification are given below. </div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the question.</div>
                    <div class="argument">We wish to record our strong objection to the phrase, “OTT” which is a standard telecom terminology limiting the vast range of Internet platforms and services to the mere way in which it is served over a network. Computer technologists, on the contrary make well accepted distinction between the networks layer (TSP’s), and the applications layer (OTT). Hence, to reduce internet platforms and services to a phrase such as OTT is incorrect. Instead of OTT, this response will use the phrase, “internet platforms and services” which is more appropriate. </div>
                    <div class="argument">This question presumes that, first, regulation is absent and second, in this absence regulation is necessary. These presumptions are incorrect and based on a wrong reading of facts and applicable laws. The regulatory framework and responses to it are contained in the substantive comments contained below. </div>
                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Reply</div>
                    <div class="argument">Internet platforms and services exist in a regulatory regime providing users services at a negligible price or one that is subsidised by contextual advertising based on user data. Any additional regulatory, licensing burden is likely to do one thing only, increase the cost of access and degrade the quality of such interactions. This will inevitably lead to higher prices and more invasive advertising online which is contrary to user interest.</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is also surprising that the consultation paper presumes that there are no legal compliances applicable to internet platforms. Internet platforms in this respect are akin to MVAS (Mobile Value Added Services) services where several TSP’s made arguments in the TRAI Consultation on MVAS arguing that no regulation was necessary. They stated that first that MVAS services operate on telecom licensees hence a compliance in terms of any security interests is ensured through licenses itself, and second MVAS services are regulated by general laws. This logically applies to Internet platforms and services equally. </div>
                    <div class="argument">It may also be considered as to the jurisdictional basis of the TRAI to consider regulating Internet Platforms and Services as opposed to issuing Network Neutrality regulations on TSPs. There may not be jurisdictional basis under the TRAI Act or even under the Telegraph Act to regulate Internet Platforms and Services. However, Network Neutrality regulations can be easily made, since TSPs are directly governed by the TRAI. </div>
                    <div class="argument">Any licensing or registration, even if soft touch such as the registration in the OSP category will destroy innovation, increase time for roll outs and also increase costs for bootstrapped entrepreneurs. The net effect will be disastrous for the internet economy. </div>

                        <li>A McKinsey Global Institute India specific report in 2012, titled as, “Online and Upcoming: The Internet’s Impact on India” notes that Internet Applications and Platforms have the ability to reach 3.6% of the GDP by 2015. This is in the absence of any fresh or additional regulatory framework [Link].</li>
                        <li>A more recent report in 2015 by the Boston Consulting Group and the IAMAI, notes that in 2013, internet applications and services actually contributed 3.2% to the national GDP and this would grow to 5% by 2020. The report in its comments calls for decreasing existing burdens on online service providers by reforms to the Information Technology Act and the Copyright Act rather than any fresh or additional regulation [Link].</li>

                        <li><strong>AIRTEL</strong>: “The telecom licenses are granted under Indian Telegraph Act 1885, to provide, establish, maintain and work telegraph. Since, Value Added Service Providers neither provide nor establish/maintain work telegraph, a license under Indian Telegraph Act may not be a legally tenable option. Also the National Telecom Policy, 1999 clearly defines the services for which licenses can be issued and there is no category of license envisaged in the National Telecom Policy, 1999 for mobile VAS companies.”</li>
                        <li><strong>BSNL</strong>: “No, the present arrangement is working fine. VAS is evolving on day to day basis dynamically changing and licensing implications of any arrangement may only create hindrance in its growth.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliance Comm.</strong>: “Globally Mobile VAS industry has worked under Free Market Practices, very much like FMCG companies. There are enough laws and regulations as Law of Land to govern VASPs. Any further regulation would only hamper creativity, innovation and its growth. Licensing may not be a favourable proposition the VAS industry simply for the fact that while we are trying to deregulate most sectors of Business and largely the entire economy, it may not be appropriate to contain this segment which is largely Web-oriented and which does not entail obtaining a License for launching a Portal. The activity does not squarely fall under the category to be licensed under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1985.”</li>

                    <div class="question">Question 2: Should the Internet/OTT players offering communication services (voice, messaging and video call services through applications (resident either in the country or outside) be brought under the licensing regime? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 2: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. No licensing of any form or kind is necessary for any form of internet platforms and services offering communication services. Such a suggestion is regressive and smacks of a partisan tilt towards TSPs.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The points which provide further justification are given below.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the question.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The framing of the question is incorrect and it again makes presumptions which are incorrectly stated in the consultation paper. It firstly presumes that a neat line exists to differentiate communication services and platforms on the internet from the rest. This is incorrect, many internet services to drive consumer engagement offer communication services incidentally.</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is also noticeable, that this question goes beyond mere &ldquo;registration&rdquo; to a much a more onerous phrase, i.e. &ldquo;licensing&rdquo;. This is incredibly dangerous and a regressive proposal which is likely to go against the interests of users and the adoption of newer and more efficient technologies.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Substantive reply</div>
                    <div class="argument">Low costs of entry are essential for innovation in the communication services market. Internet content and applications market can be understood as a &ldquo;hit-driven industry,&rdquo; where hit products like Skype, Whatsapp and others create massive spillover value for users. But extreme uncertainty plagues the creation of distinctly new products, and for every successful product there have been numerous failures. Given that the returns to content production are skewed and the expected value of a new online venture is low, sufficiently low costs of entry have been and continue to be crucial. These costs will rise if any mandatory licensing is enforced even on pure communication services offered through the internet.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Communication services which do operate on the internet layer are served through telecom licensees. Here, there is a well-articulated need for a license for the telecoms, which function as a &ldquo;pipe&rdquo;. This requires the utilisation of spectrum that is allocated to a TSP. This can be used for data, voice and sms. The network is agnostic to the transmission however it does require, physical infrastructure, quality of service, payments etc. Hence, the licenses which are played on telecom service providers have a demonstrable need and social necessity. These needs are largely absent from internet platforms and services. Moreover since they are served over existing licensed TSP networks there is no need for an additional license.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Communication services are also used incidentally by e-commerce retailers, online matrimony websites etc. which often provide needed anonymity provide such messaging services. It is not understood how such services and their product innovation will be affected.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Corresponding Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">There was a license for POP3 email services in India (1990-1993) which were subsequently abolished. With the proliferation of web based email services there were no licenses or additional registrations for web based email providers in India. This not only incentivised greater adoption of lower costs, but also increased consumer choice.</div>

                    <div class="question">Question 3: Is the growth of Internet/OTT impacting the traditional revenue stream of Telecom operators/Telecom operators? If so, is the increase in data revenues of the Telecom Operators sufficient to compensate for this impact? Please comment with reasons.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 3: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. Even on the data points in the consultation paper which indicate a loss in revenue streams in voice and sms the increase in revenue in data leads to a net profit for TSPs. Present trends and expert reports indicate that data usage will drive growth and revenue for TSPs.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the question</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question presumes that revenue loss is occurring to a TSPs, &ldquo;traditional revenue streams&rdquo;. The traditional revenue streams under a USAL license include data services which are showing a tremendous growth in revenue due to increased adoption of internet platforms and services. Hence, the framing of the question itself is incorrect as it fails to consider revenue from data services a traditional revenue stream.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Response</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question presumes that Internet platforms and services (even those which offer communication services) act as substitutes for voice and messaging facilities offered by TSPs. This is incorrect. Users utilise each specific platform distinctly where for instance, a VOIP call does not offer the same clarity as a call on a voice platform or an instant messaging application such as WhatsApp is rather used for chatting than a SMS feature which is usually used for notification. Usage over each technology offers distinct benefits and costs which are considered by users. A diversity of sources is healthy and allows a greater degree of consumer choice.</div>
                    <div class="argument">A direct correlation between increased adoption in data over voice and messaging has not been adequately demonstrated. A loss in revenue for messaging and voice may also be attributable to other factors rather than pure substitution or the purported cannibalisation of a TSP&rsquo;s revenues. Other factors which deserve recognition include, i) TRAI&rsquo;s Unsolicited Communications Regulations which now prevent SMS&rsquo;s spam and hence impact revenue; ii) Poor quality of service which cause frequent call drops making calls shorter. These points are documented in data points.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The available data and public statements by various telecom companies itself demonstrates that no case exists of revenue cannibalisation by internet based voice and messaging services. On the contrary data usage are driving demand and greater adoption for telecom networks. Here, it is important that TRAI should not through regulation prevent the benefits of technology from flowing to users in India.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Corresponding Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">On cannibalisation of revenues</div>
                    <div class="argument">The Morgan Stanley report on Indian Telecoms [<a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-06-15/news/50598278_1_data-subscribers-data-contribution-whatsapp">link</a>] states that the benefits of growth in growing adoption of Internet Applications and Platforms Services to Mobile Service Providers (TSPs). Some excerpts are provided below:</div>
                    <div class="argument">&ldquo;Data is the next growth leg. We expect data contribution to more than double to ~23% of overall revenues (vs. 10% currently) in the next two years. Data revenues should grow at a ~40% CAGR over F14-F18, leading to a 384 bps increase in industry revenues to 12.3% over the period.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="argument">&ldquo;Voice and data rates are the lowest for Indian operators as compared to Asian counterparts and the difference between voice rate per minute and data rate per MB is not significant. Thus, the risk of data cannibalizing voice is very low.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="section-head">&ldquo;Industry Growth Story Looks Intact&rdquo;.</div>
                    <div class="argument">A Google/A.T.

                    <div class="argument">A study by Nokia titled as the, &ldquo;India Mobile Broadband Index 2015&rdquo; notes that towards the end of 2014, there has been a sharp increase in 3G Data Connections and data usage on 3G networks has gone beyond the data consumption of 2G Networks. It concludes by stating that, &ldquo;Data traffic growth is reflecting fast in mobile data revenue growth for telecom operators &ndash; a sign of healthy growth in Indian telecom industry.&rdquo;</div>

                    <div class="question">Question 4: Should the Internet/OTT players pay for use of the Telecom Operators network over and above data charges paid by consumers? If yes, what pricing options can be adopted? Could such options include prices based on bandwidth consumption? Can prices be used as a means of product/service differentiation? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 4: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. Any regulatory intervention which permits additional charges on customers on the type of services accessed beyond the access charges at present will not only be against consumer interest by increasing costs but also impair innovation and adoption in the types of services used.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>
                    <div class="argument">This question presumes cannibalisation of revenue as well as a risk to the financial viability of telecom operators by existing revenue models to levy additional costs for access for the type of service. This presumption is incorrect as per the data and various reports cited, including but not limited to financial reports of telecom companies itself in the answer to Question No. 3.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question also lacks specificity when it states that. &ldquo;Prices based on bandwidth consumption&rdquo;. At present prices by TSPs for mobile bandwidth as well as fixed line internet access are on the basis of the volume of data usage by users. Additionally TSPs have adopted a practice of Fair Usage Policies (FUP), which even limit the amount of data or regulate speeds in data packs which are marketed to permit, &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; internet access in a given billing cycle.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Reply</div>
                    <div class="argument">A specific access fee to access a specific service or even a type of service will result in a higher and a non-transparent cost to users. Most internet platforms and services are content rich and cannot be divided into a neat silos of the type of service they provide as per bandwidth consumption. For instance many websites embed videos and even embed links and functionality from online media hosting services. Hence any additional cost beyond mere volume will not have any transparency and will be impossible for users to contemplate and have adequate notice prior to accessing the page itself. Even after such access ceases, many elements of the content may not be visible causing charges which will be impossible if not tough to monitor. This will not only increase costs without any justification but also violate the TRAI guidelines on transparent billing. The Quality of Service (Code of Practice for Metering and Billing Accuracy) Regulations, 2006 expressly cite transparency and notice in the tariff plan which will not be possible to achieve in case of discriminatory billing of traffic.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Economic analysis demonstrates that access fees hinders innovation in the application layer. Any charges which are levied will need to be on a rational basis of differentiation which as stated above is not possible. Even when the basis itself is determined, it will inevitably through regulation favour certain firms, or types of services. Hence, this will hinder innovation and especially disincentivise users from accessing certain platforms and services.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The need for any such additional levy is also not well articulated. Data points on this including statements by telecom companies, earnings reports and certification agency statements all indicate that the revenues and profits from data usage are growing. Even the long term debt forecast for telecom companies is projected to be stable. Hence at present any such additional pricing beyond pure connectivity will amount to double dipping at a cost to the user.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Such differential pricing also has the ability to fragment the internet. At present most websites to a large degree interlink and cross post content which provides a seamless experience while surfing the internet. This allows greater efficiencies in the sharing of knowledge across multiple internet services and platforms. A differential pricing will prevent any such seamless experience. This proposal also has the tendency to promote larger internet platforms and services in order to promote their services to implement zero rating services to the disadvantage of competing firms with lower capital resources and which may even offer better products.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">On the issue of sharing of revenue The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) comments on the submission of the European Telecommunications Network Operators (ENTO) to the World Conference on International Telecommunications 2012 states that, &ldquo;BEREC believes that the nature of services to be delivered across the network, and the charging mechanisms applied to them, should continue to be left to commercial negotiations among stakeholders. In such a fast-moving and dynamic field, to raise their profile through explicit reference in an international treaty revised every 25 years is inappropriate and could be prejudicial to the continued development of the Internet, having real potential to harm consumers and content and applications providers (CAPs), disrupt access to content, and contribute to a widening of the digital divide.&rdquo; [<a href="http://berec.europa.eu/files/document_register_store/2012/11/BoR_%2812%29_120_BEREC_on_ITR.pdf">Link</a>]</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question also fails to consider infrastructure costs are not only borne by Telecom Operators but also companies which utilise substantial traffic on telecom networks. These strong incentives exist when a neutral network is provided to them as explained in the Analysys Mason Report titled as, &ldquo;Overview of recent changes in the IP interconnection exosystem&rdquo; [<a href="http://www.broadbandforamerica.com/sites/default/themes/broadband/images/pdf/analysys_mason_domestic_peering_paper.pdf">Link</a>] which is quoted extensively below:</div>
                    <div class="argument">&ldquo;Content providers themselves may use a similar configuration to build a content delivery network for their own content. For instance, Google has embarked on a Google Global Cache project with similar goals to a CDN, in this case to locate Google servers within ISP networks.36 The difference from a CDN is that Google servers are dedicated to Google content. Other content providers such as Microsoft are also building such networks to deliver content, such as Microsoft‟s video games.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="argument">&ldquo;Even smaller content providers can also use technology to lower their costs, avoiding not just transit charges, but also the use of CDNs. For instance, Vudu delivers high-quality video on demand to end users‟ TVs via a dedicated set-top box that is external or integrated into a TV or Blu-ray player. Each device has a large hard drive, which contains the first few seconds of each title in order to enable the title to begin as soon as it is chosen. The rest of the chosen content is pieced together via an Internet connection to the device, using peer-to-peer networking from other Vudu devices that have stored that content. As a result, a user is able to watch high-definition movies with no delay with as little as a 4Mbit/s broadband connection.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="argument">&ldquo;As a result of the volume of traffic that they deliver, and the associated cost of delivering that traffic, content providers have a strong incentive to build out their networks in order to reduce their transit requirements and deliver the traffic directly to the ISP network, if not from within the ISP‟s network. As a result of the increasing monetization of content, providers also have the means to engage in such network build-outs.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="argument">On the stated concern of protecting the, &ldquo;traditional revenue model&rdquo; of TSPs, ratio of the Supreme Court of India in the locus classicus on telecommunications law, in the case of Ministry of I&amp;B v. Cricket Association of Bengal [<a href="http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=10896">Link</a>] has held that, &ldquo;[a]irwaves being public property, it is the duty of the State to see that airwaves are so utilized as to plurality and diversity of views, opinions and ideas. This is imperative in every democracy where freedom of speech is assured. The free speech right guaranteed to every citizen of this country does not encompass the right to use these airwaves at his choosing. Conceding such a right would be detrimental to the free speech rights of the body of citizens in as much as only a privileged few - powerful economic, commercial and political interests - would come to dominate the media. By manipulating the news, views and information, by indulging in misinformation and disinformation, to suit their commercial or other interests, they would be harming - and not serving - the principle of plurality and diversity of views, news, ideas and opinions.&rdquo;. Mandating licensing and also not enacting a network neutrality legislation will negatively impact this plurality and diversity.</div>

                    <div class="question">Question 5: Do you agree that imbalances exist in the regulatory environment in the operation of Internet/OTT players? If so, what should be the framework to address these issues? How can the prevailing laws and regulations be applied to Internet/OTT players (who operate in the virtual world) and compliance enforced? What could be the impact on the economy? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 5: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. No regulatory imbalances exist in the regulatory environment in the operation of internet platforms and services. Prevalent laws and legal regulations apply equally to Internet platforms and services and even enforcement is implemented through them. Any imbalances which do exist is due to the nature of the services itself.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question follows the previous approach of posing a query which frames any response in opposition to seem defensive. This is pertinent to mention given that this and previous questions arise from either an ignorance or misstatement of fact and law.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Prevalent laws and regulations equally apply to Internet platforms and services apply equally to Internet platforms and services as is explained in the response below. Moreover, the economic impact of any further regulation without a well-articulated interest, or one which furthers ambiguity will be disastrous for the Indian technology industry.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Comments</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question inasmuch it states that, &ldquo;regulatory imbalances&rdquo; exist ignores that substantial differences exist between internet applications and services and telecom or ISP licensees. Rather than, &ldquo;imbalances&rdquo;, these are distinctions. Here the motivation to impose additional regulation on internet platforms and services is not understood and is neither well-articulated. The same &ldquo;regulatory imbalances&rdquo; were cited in the MVAS regulation in which arguments on two specific points were made to prevent mandatory licensing. The first that such services use the pipes of TSPs which are pre-existing licensees and second general laws govern such services.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Prevailing laws and regulations are equally applicable on internet services and platforms and are made applicable in the following manner:</div>
                    <div class="argument">Most internet specific laws have jurisdictional clauses which make substantive laws applicable to where the content is accessed or the crime is caused. Such extra-territorial provisions which deem jurisdiction in such cases of illegality are contained within the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860.</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is also important to mention the Supreme Court of India&rsquo;s recent pronouncement in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India where it has had occasion to comment on the liability of intermediaries. Most internet platforms and services fall within this category as they do not create content, but provide platforms. Hence, end users most of which are residents in India will be liable. This is not only as per the dicta of the court but the conscious policy decision of the government in enacting Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, which makes such platforms, even if they provide communication platforms immune from liability for the acts of users.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Specific provisions exist for blocking of platforms from access in India as well as issuing letters rugatory for compelling the attendance of an accused. These process provide an adequate balance to international entities which provide.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Any additional concerns on privacy and security are already under consideration of several government committees and have already been commented on including but not limited to the National Cyber Security Policy, 2013. These measures may properly be considered by an interministerial group composing of representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, rather in isolation by TRAI.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">Ratio of the Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India:
                      <p>At Para 117, &ldquo;Section 79(3)(b) has to be read down to mean that the intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge that a court order has been passed asking it to expeditiously remove or disable access to certain material must then fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material. This is for the reason that otherwise it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not. We have been informed that in other countries worldwide this view has gained acceptance, Argentina being in the forefront. Also, the Court order and/or the notification by the appropriate Government or its agency must strictly conform to the subject matters laid down in Article 19(2). Unlawful acts beyond what is laid down in Article 19(2) obviously cannot form any part of Section 79. With these two caveats, we refrain from striking down Section 79(3).&rdquo;</p>
                      <p>At para 118, &ldquo;However, Rule 3(4) needs to be read down in the same manner as Section 79(3)(b). The knowledge spoken of in the said sub-rule must only be through the medium of a court order. Subject to this, the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 are valid.&rdquo;</p>

                    <div class="question">Question 6: How should the security concerns be addressed with regard to Internet/OTT players providing communication services? What security conditions such as maintaining data records, logs etc. need to be mandated for such Internet/OTT players? And, how can compliance with these conditions be ensured if the applications of such Internet/OTT players reside outside the country? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 6: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. At present enough regulations exist to mandate security conditions and interception of information. Further any proposals for additional regulations is required to consider the privacy interests of users. In cases of internet services and platforms located outside India, in cases of non-compliance, as an extreme measure legal provisions permit the blocking of the domain itself.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>
                    <div class="argument">The question presumes that Internet and OTT Players which provide communication services are not obligated by law to comply with information requests. This incorrect on facts as well as law.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Any proposal to enforce security conditions requires a comprehensive privacy law which as per media reports is being drafted by an interministerial group piloted by the DoPT. Security concerns cannot be addressed in a vacuum without addressing the privacy concerns of users.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>
                    <div class="argument">Much of the communication services which operate are on existing TSP networks who monitor them as per information requests under Rule 419B of the Telegraph Rules as well as under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguard for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009.</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is also relevant to consider that independent obligations on Internet / OTT players exist both for data retention. There exist comprehensive regulation which is presently being relied by State authorities which includes courts, police departments and security agencies. These include the following:</div>
                    <div class="argument">The retention of sensitive personal information as defined under Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, is provided as per Rule 5(4) of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information), 2011 which states that any, body corporate shall not retain data for longer than necessary unless mandated by a provision of law.</div>
                    <div class="argument">This retention period is then defined for a period of 90 days for the preservation of information and associated records for the purposes of any investigation as per Rule 3(4) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Further Rule 3(7) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011 states that, &ldquo;when required by lawful order, the intermediary shall provide information or any assistance to Government Agencies who are lawfully authorised for investigative, protective, cyber security activity. The information or any such assistance shall be provided for the purpose of verification of identity, or for prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, cyber security incidents and punishment of offences under any law for thaw time being in force, on a request in writing stating clearly the purpose of seeking such information or any such assistance.&rdquo;</div>
                    <div class="argument">Further independent provisions exist under other laws which are utilised by law enforcement, security agencies and courts to compel the production of such information including Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is also submitted that any further regulation to mandate the provision of user information will not only impact internet platforms or services, but will be a breach of privacy of users. This breach has with adequate safeguards and a comprehensive legislation which addresses them.</div>
                    <div class="argument">In cases of non-compliance, the government as well as courts can block platforms and websites as has been done in the past. One of the grounds for which many websites have been blocked include national security and public order. This is as per the provisions which exist under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. As an extreme measure, even if websites are located abroad, these legal provisions may be utilised to block access to the platform or service in India itself by issuing an order to TSPs and ISPs.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">The factual implementation of the legal provisions cited above are evident from the transparency reports of major internet platforms and services. It is important to note that this data which is made available by individual web companies is the only available public data since such interception requests and even aggregated data on it is not being disclosed by government entities. It is also relevant to note that no TSP is at present publishing or submitting such data to the TRAI, which is important to ensure accountability and transparency in cases of privacy breaches.</div>

                    <div class="answer">Answer 7: The answer to the above question is in the negative for the parent and the nested questions. Though at present the privacy protections for users of such services needs to be improved it has to be done through a comprehensive enactment as is being considered by the Government. The security and safety interests can be determined by sectoral enactments as well as general penal provisions.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>
                    <div class="argument">The consultation paper makes several comments in user interest with respect to which are not properly within the scope of the TRAI to make. Even TSPs and ISPs at present are not mandated with extensive security, safety and privacy regulations. In any case no such data from such entities is published and no regulatory system is in place to monitor their compliance.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The consumer interest does not require that in the name of security, safety and privacy regulations are made to further the interests of TSPs. The motivation for this paper and several questions is properly the factually incorrect arguments made by TSPs. It would be useful if the framing of the paper was limited to it.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Response</div>
                    <div class="argument">The concerns with respect to security of Users are addressed to an extent by way of Sections 43A and 72 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Though inadequate due to defects in the framing of the law and its enforcement further protection needs to be extended in a holistic manner though a comprehensive law with ensures user security, safety and privacy. This is already being examined by the government and the TRAI is not the proper body to make such considerations.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The Justice Shah Report on privacy recognises that information privacy is an evolving aspect which requires constant regulatory oversight by a dedicated body. Hence it has recommended a multi-tired system of enforcement which includes, privacy commissioners, an ombudsman as well as civil courts. It is suggested that larger concerns on data must be addressed through such a comprehensive approach.</div>
                    <div class="argument">With respect to the real world effects of online platforms and services, in circumstances where they may be used to commit criminal acts, the proper response on this should be two fold. At first the general penal provisions under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 should be utilised, thereafter sectoral regulators should step in to form guidelines and update them to permit innovation and ensure user safety at the same time.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Finally it is also a point of concern that the TRAI has not made any such regulations or recommendations to govern TSPs and ISPs. The regulations which are imposed are limited to their license conditions which are inadequate. In any case, no data is reported to the TRAI and no audits are conducted to ensure the safety, security and privacy of Users of TSP and ISP services. From routine privacy breaches such as telemarketing, even more serious violations of leaking of call details of senior politicians has been documents. However unfortunately till date no regulatory intervention has taken place to ensure the best interests of Users.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">The Planning commission had constituted a Small Group of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice A.P.Shah, Former Chief Justice, Delhi High Court to identify the privacy issues and prepare a paper to facilitate authoring the Privacy Bill which was submitted on October 16, 2012 [<a href="http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf">link</a>]. The summary of recommendations contained recommended a comprehensive Indian Privacy Act which were submitted to the Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India. It is a cause of concern that no further public comment has been made on these recommendations and neither has any draft law been released for public comments.</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is also a cause of concern in users in the country that a mass surveillance, Central Monitoring System has been implemented without any statutory basis or regulatory sanction providing for safeguards. This is a cause of concern as it has been revealed that, &ldquo;However, in reality, these safeguards stand violated for the most part. This is because a majority of the Indian ISPs neither have the government&rsquo;s LIM system installed nor do they have functional nodal officers &mdash; and, as a result, the ISP-level mandatory check for authenticating government&rsquo;s monitoring orders to protect user privacy is absent. In effect, all Internet traffic of any user is open to interception at the international gateway of the bigger ISP from whom the smaller ISPs buy bandwidth.&rdquo; [<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-violates-privacy-safeguards-to-secretly-monitor-internet-traffic/article5107682.ece?homepage=true">Link</a>]. Hence, the first step to ensure the safety, security and privacy of users is to mandate compliance by TSPs and ISPs.</div>
                    <div class="question">Question 8: In what manner can the proposals for a regulatory framework for OTTs in India draw from those of ETNO, referred to in para 4.23 or the best practices summarised in para 4.29? And, what practices should be proscribed by regulatory fiat? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>

                    <div class="argument">It is surprising that the TRAI chose to frame a question on ETNO&rsquo;s proposals given that it notices several other jurisdictions. The ETNO proposal is the most regressive and partial towards TSPs. It has also been severely criticised and does not hold credibility internationally. It is hoped any future reference to the proposal will be avoided to prevent the appearance of bias in favour of TSPs.</div>
                    <div class="argument">The ETNO is an inncocous acronym for a group of European Telecom Companies, which is at best a industry organisation [<a href="https://www.etno.eu/home/about-us/our-members-and-observers">Link</a>]. Its counterpart in India would be the COAI. Hence any question which is prompted on the basis of such a proposal will reflect a single stakeholders positions and not be neutral. It is also to be stated that this proposal was not publicly available and only revealed due to a leak. [<a href="http://tinyurl.com/8eyz3g9">Link</a>] Even at present users do not know the precise text of the proposals and representations made by the COAI which have led to the present consultation paper.</div>

                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Response</div>

                    <div class="argument">Above and beyond the framing of Question No. 8, the ETNO&rsquo;s proposal would increase costs for users and specifically effect the growing adoption of the Internet in India. In sum and substance the proposal contemplates a, &ldquo;sending parties pays&rdquo; approach to interconnection which could lead to, &ldquo;increased cost of Internet access for users everywhere, limit the ability of upstart entrepreneurs, innovators, and content creators all over the world to access global online market, and could limit the ability of users in smaller or less developed countries to access the global network.&rdquo; (Source : Access Now).</div>
                    <div class="argument">Available data such as the Analysys Mason Report cited previously as well as the following data points illustrate that larger internet platforms and services invest sizeable money in software, hardware and infrastructure. These costs are at present made voluntarily by them to ensure faster access for their users and include the use of Content Delivery Networks such as Akamai. Hence any statement that large, bandwidth intensive, internet platforms and services do not contribute financially to the infrastructure is factually incorrect.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Data Points</div>
                    <div class="argument">The Center for Demoracy and Technology commenting on ETNO&rsquo;s proposals stated that, &ldquo;Nobody disputes that telcos need to generate revenues sufficient to sustain investment. But it&rsquo;s just not true that, as ETNO asserts, &ldquo;Over the Top players . . . are not contributing to network investment.&rdquo; Providers of popular online content and services already invest huge amounts of money in their own networks, bandwidth, and CDN deployment in order to stay competitive as traffic grows; they interconnect with telcos via freely negotiated agreements; and they fuel customer demand for broadband Internet access. European member states are meeting this week to discuss regional proposals to amend the ITRs.&rdquo; [<a href="https://cdt.org/blog/doubling-down-with-double-speak-etno-responds-to-critics/">Link</a>]</div>
                    <div class="argument">Access Now commented on the ETNO proposal stating that, &ldquo;Ultimately, the ETNO proposal is likely to allow telecoms to obtain more revenue from content and platform providers, but not to increase internet access, as companies will probably be reluctant to invest in user communities that are less profitable, be they less developed countries or not-for-profit entities. Indeed, violating net neutrality will definitely represent a significant hurdle for entrepreneurs and/or innovators with less capital or financial resources to sustain their growth. Eventually we must ask ourselves which values we want to use and manage the internet. If we agree that certain values, such as openness, decentralization, and neutrality have been integral to internet architecture and growth from the start, we must guard against any private interest which threatens to defeat this obvious public gain.&rdquo; [<a href="https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2012/10/16/say-it-aint-so-etno-dangerous-proposal-threatens-net-neutrality">Link</a>]</div>
                    <div class="argument">Article 19 further stated that, &ldquo;the European Telecoms Network Operators (ETNO) proposal should be rejected as undermining the net neutrality principle.&rdquo; [<a href="http://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/3483/12-10-19-LA-itu.pdf">Link</a>]</div>
                    <div class="argument">The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) in response to the ETNO proposal stated that, &ldquo;It is in all our interests to protect the continued development of the open, dynamic and global platform that the Internet provides, which has evolved over time (without regulatory intervention), and helped enable so much innovation at the network endpoints. ETNO&rsquo;s proposal could undermine this and therefore lead to an overall loss of welfare.&rdquo; [<a href="http://berec.europa.eu/files/document_register_store/2012/11/BoR_%2812%29_120_BEREC_on_ITR.pdf">Link</a>]</div>
                    <div class="argument">Finally the ETNO proposal which was made before the Conference of European Posts and Telegraphs (CEPT) determined on October 17/18, 2012 that the ITU is not the appropriate forum to discuss ETNO's proposals.

                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>
                    <div class="argument">It is regretful that the consultation paper which leads to the framing of the present question follows an approach which gives an appearance of bias in favour of TSPs. Paragraph 5.47 commences from what seems is an elaborate quote of an article in the Economist containing arguments against network neutrality. This purported quote is placed in a box, and gives an appearance that this the Economist&rsquo;s editorial position. However this is factually incorrect as the Economist article of the same day and on the same topic has been paraphrased and TSP sympathetic arguments have been inserted unilaterally. The article rather than making a broader point against network neutrality in principle states it&rsquo;s a work in progress which is completely omitted from the consultation paper. [<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business/21641257-rules-road-internet-will-always-be-work-progress-be-continued">Link</a>]</div>
                    <div class="argument">It would not be out of place to state that this approach gives an appearance of bias to the entire consultation process in favour of TSPs and against users of the Internet. It is hoped that such factual inaccuracies are limited to this and do not extend beyond it.</div>

                    <div class="argument">An agreed definition of Network Neutrality is contained by the Global Net Neutrality Coalition in which more than 35 organisations from 17 countries are members as, &ldquo;Net neutrality requires that the internet be maintained as an open platform, on which network providers treat all content, applications and services equally, without discrimination.&rdquo; [<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/access.3cdn.net/6fe13024e81dc2d55c_3gm6iir98.pdf">Link</a>] This would include the following principles which are then substantiated in the data points which are provided:</div>
                    <div class="argument">No blocking by TSPs and ISPs on specific forms of internet traffic, services and applications.</div>
                    <div class="argument">No slowing or &ldquo;throttling&rdquo; internet speeds by TSPs and ISPs on specific forms of internet traffic, services and applications.</div>

                    <div class="argument">No preferential treatment of services and platforms by TSPs and ISPs.</div>

                    <div class="argument">These principles, notably the principle of preferential treatment has been under consideration of several foreign jurisdictions. Notable amongst them are Chile and Brazil which have taken a position through regulation to prevent any such preferential treatment, or, &ldquo;fast lanes&rdquo; for specific forms of internet traffic. Amongst developed countries, other examples include the recently adopted Open Internet Order by the FCC in the United States and Norway.</div>

                    <div class="argument">A model network neutrality framework may include the following conditions made by the Dynamic Coalition on Network Neutrality (which has the support of the Council of Europe) [<a href="http://www.networkneutrality.info/sources.html">Link</a>]. The specific model network neutrality model suggested by them includes the following points:</div>
                    <div class="argument">Model Framework on Network Neutrality</div>
                    <div class="argument">(initiated by the Council of Europe and developed by the Dynamic Coalition on Network Neutrality)</div>
                    <div class="argument">1) Network neutrality is the principle according to which Internet traffic shall be treated equally, without discrimination, restriction or interference regardless of its sender, recipient, type or content, so that Internet users&rsquo; freedom of choice is not restricted by favouring or disfavouring the transmission of Internet traffic associated with particular content, services, applications, or devices.</div>
                    <div class="argument">2) In accordance with the network neutrality principle, Internet service providers shall refrain from discriminating, restricting, or otherwise interfering with the transmission of Internet traffic, unless such interference is strictly necessary and proportionate to:</div>
                    <div class="argument">a) give effect to a legislative provision or court order;</div>
                    <div class="argument">b) preserve the integrity and security of the network, services and the Internet users' terminal equipment;</div>
                    <div class="argument">c) prevent the transmission of unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes to Internet users who have given their prior consent to such restrictive measures;</div>
                    <div class="argument">d) comply with an explicit request from the subscriber, provided that this request is given freely and is not incentivised by the Internet service provider or its commercial partner;</div>
                    <div class="argument">e) mitigate the effects of temporary and exceptional network congestion, primarily by means of application-agnostic measures or, when these measures do not prove efficient, by means of application-specific measures.</div>
                    <div class="argument">3) The network neutrality principle shall apply to all Internet access services and Internet transit services offered by ISPs, regardless of the underlying technology used to transmit signals.</div>

                    <div class="argument">4) The network neutrality principle need not apply to specialised services. Internet service providers should be allowed to offer specialised services in addition to Internet access service, provided that such offerings are not to the detriment of Internet access services, or their performance, affordability, or quality. Offerings to deliver specialised services should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis and their adoption by Internet users should be voluntary.</div>

                    <div class="argument">5) Subscribers of Internet access service have the right to receive and use a public and globally unique Internet address.</div>

                    <div class="argument">6) Any techniques to inspect or analyse Internet traffic shall be in accordance with privacy and data protection legislation. By default, such techniques should only examine header information. The use of any technique which inspects or analyses the content of communications should be reviewed by the relevant national data protection authority to assess compliance with the applicable privacy and data protection obligations.</div>

                    <div class="argument">7) Internet service providers shall provide intelligible and transparent information with regard to their traffic management practices and usage polices, notably with regard to the coexistence of Internet access service and specialised services. When network capacity is shared between Internet access services and specialised services, the criteria whereby network capacity is shared, shall be clearly stated.</div>

                    <div class="argument">8) The competent national regulatory authority shall:</div>
                    <div class="argument">a)  be mandated to regularly monitor and report on Internet traffic management practices and usage polices, in order to ensure network neutrality, evaluate the potential impact of the aforementioned practices and policies on fundamental rights, ensure the provision of a sufficient quality of service and the allocation of a satisfactory level of network capacity to the Internet. Reporting should be done in an open and transparent fashion and reports shall be made freely available to the public;</div>
                    <div class="argument">b)  put in place appropriate, clear, open and efficient procedures aimed at addressing network neutrality complaints. To this end, all Internet users shall be entitled to make use of such complaint procedures in front of the relevant authority;</div>
                    <div class="argument">c)  respond to the complaints within a reasonable time and be able to use necessary measures in order to sanction thebreach of the network neutrality principle.</div>
                    <div class="argument">This authority must have the necessary resources to undertake the aforementioned duties in a timelyand effective manner.</div>

                    <div class="argument">a)  The &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is the publicly accessible electronic communications network of networks that use the Internet Protocol for communication with endpoints reachable, directly or through network address translation, via a globally unique Internet address.</div>
                    <div class="argument">b)  The expression &ldquo;Internet service provider&rdquo; refers to any legal person that offers Internet access service to the public or Internet transit service to another ISP.</div>
                    <div class="argument">c)  The expression &ldquo;Internet access service&rdquo; refers to a publicly available electronic communications service that provides connectivity to the Internet, and thereby provides the ability to the subscriber or Internet user to receive and impart data from and to the Internet, irrespective of the underlying technology used to transmit signals.</div>
                    <div class="argument">d)  The expression &ldquo;Internet transit service&rdquo; refers to the electronic communications service that provides connectivity between Internet service providers.</div>
                    <div class="argument">e)   The expression &ldquo;Internet traffic&rdquo; refers to any flow of data packets transmitted through the Internet, regardless of the application or device that generated it.</div>
                    <div class="argument">​f)   The expression &ldquo;specialised services&rdquo; refers to electronic communications services that are provided and operated within closed electronic communications networks using the Internet Protocol, but not being part of the Internet. The expression &ldquo;closed electronic communications networks&rdquo; refers to networks that rely on strict admission control.</div>
                    <div class="argument">g)  The expression &ldquo;application-agnostic&rdquo; refers to Internet traffic management practices, measures and techniques that do not depend on the characteristics of specific applications, content, services, devices and uses.</div>
                    <div class="argument">h)  The expression &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; refers to the natural or legal person who has entered into an agreement with an Internet service provider to receive Internet access service.</div>

                    <div class="argument">j) The expression &ldquo;Internet user&rdquo; refers to the natural or legal person who is using Internet access service, and in that capacity has the freedom to impart and receive information, and to use or offer applications and services through devices of their choice. The Internet user may be the subscriber, or any person to whom the subscriber has granted the right to use the Internet access service s/he receives. Any legal person offering content and/or applications on the Internet is also an Internet user.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Brazil&rsquo;s Marco Civil Law also provides a model which may be adopted.

                    <div class="question">Question 10: What forms of discrimination or traffic management practices are reasonable and consistent with a pragmatic approach? What should or can be permitted? Please comment with justifications.</div>
                    <div class="answer">Answer 10: Discrimination should only be permitted for traffic management and ensuring the integrity of the network. Even otherwise any determination beyond it should on a case to case basis determination for compliance and ensuring it is not to the detriment of Internet access services, or their performance, affordability, or quality. In any such determination complete transparency should be maintained.</div>
                    <div class="section-head">Framing of the Question</div>

                    <div class="argument">The question proceeds on a basis that discrimination or traffic management should be permitted as a course. Rather it should recognise that any such discrimination should be an exception rather than the rule. The rule as per any network neutrality regulation should be to prevent it.</div>
                    <div class="argument">Any such discrimination including pure traffic management requires a transparent process in which only under limited parameters it is permitted. This will require regular audits and publication of reports by TSPs under the supervision of the TRAI.</div>

                    <div class="section-head">Substantive Reply</div>
                    <div class="argument">Faced with a growing call on discriminatory access to the internet, In May 2012, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) published the findings of a joint investigation with the European Commission regarding traffic management. It revealed an increased trend of operators restricting access to services and sites. The most frequently reported restrictions are the blocking and/or throttling of peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, on both fixed and mobile networks, and the blocking of internet telephony (Voice over IP), mostly on mobile networks [<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Traffic%20Management%20Investigation%20BEREC_2.pdf">Link</a>]. Hence, there exists every possibility of abuse by TSPs if a general rule is made in favour of permitting traffic management or any discrimination with respect to data on the Internet. Hence, the definition of, &ldquo;traffic management&rdquo; should to be specific and limited.</div>
                    <div class="argument">An accountable process is required to be implement any such specific exemptions and carve outs from the general rule which prohibits discrimination. Such a process requires regulatory oversight by TRAI, where all such discrimination is monitored, audited and civil penalties are imposed for any violations. Further, the TRAI should also be open to complaints for Internet users and investigate them in case of any discrepancies in data.</div>

                    <div class="argument">Any further discrimination beyond, &ldquo;traffic management&rdquo;, in the form of any continuous practice should only be permitted if it is not to the detriment of Internet access services, or their performance, affordability, or quality. Prior to the roll out of any such discriminatory service, prior sanction and approval of the TRAI or any competent body is essential through a public hearing, conducted transparently on the basis of which a regulatory order is passed either permitting or disapproving such discrimination.</div>
