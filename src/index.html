          <p>The Deonar Dumping Ground in Mumbai is a century old, one of Asia's largest dumping grounds that is still in use.
            There are frequent fires in the ground, and it emits toxic gases like Dioxin, heavy intensity smoke and very strong stench.
            Such occurrences, through the year, have had a significant daily impact on the Air Quality of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai  areas, and every citizen has been deprived
            of the basic right of clean air to breathe. </p>

            of your citizens. This alternate site should be of a sufficient size and scale as would be required to replace the Deonar dumping ground. </p>
